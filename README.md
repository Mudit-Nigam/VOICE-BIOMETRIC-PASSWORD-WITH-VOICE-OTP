# VOICE-BIOMETRIC-PASSWORD-WITH-VOICE-OTP
A voice recognition based password system which sends you a voice OTP (a combination of 4 random words from a pre recorded list) and the user is expected to speak those words to confirm the authentication ,i.e. , to confirm the password the voice has to be of the user as well as the words need to be as expected. 
The existing voice biometric systems do not use the OTP based 2-step verification and the user is expected to repeat the same words every time, so it is easy to bypass the security using recorded voice of the user. This cannot be done with our system because not only the userâ€™s voice has to be matched but also the sentence has to be matched.
Our system will ask user to read a text file (50 words) to record and save all the words in his/her voice. When a 2-step verification is requested the system will randomly pick 4 words out of the saved words and dictate the words, which the user has to repeat to confirm the authentication.
This system is of special use for visually impaired people as well as for improved security for normal users.
